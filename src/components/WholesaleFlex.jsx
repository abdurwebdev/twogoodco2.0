        <p>As an accredited social enterprise, 50% of all profits are reinvested into supporting, empowering and employing women with lived experience of domestic violence and homelessness.</p>
        <p>Through our Work Work program, we employ and empower vulnerable women to believe in themselves again, bridging a 'love and skills' gap in the workplace as they re-establish their self worth and independence. We currently employ around 58 women a year...but our goal is to employ 80 women a year, every year. And we need your help. The more soap we sell, the more women we can employ, and the more impact we can make in your local community.</p>
        <p>...which means you can Change The Course of vulnerable women's lives, just through buying washroom consumables you're already purchasing.</p>
