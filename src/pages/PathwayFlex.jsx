        <p>In collaboration with Ecstra and the American Express Foundation, we’ve created a tool to connect thousands of vulnerable women to resources and services that empower you to achieve financial freedom and independence, in order to change the course of your life. Dive into our video stories from women who have been where you are now, and explore the network of pathways that will help lead you to financial independence - from healing from financial abuse, to improving financial literacy and gaining employment.</p>
